# Rock, Paper Scissors

This exercise required me to create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game.  The brief required the user as player and a computer opponent that selected it's choice at random.

The game is to run for a best of 5 rounds.  Ties give +1 point and wins give +1 point.  Each round had an alert so the player knows what the score is after each round.  When a player has won the game with a score of three, the game says who has won and exits out.
